*pypbcms* distinguishes between the server and the clients.
The server
 - is the node all other nodes connect to
 - controlls the other nodes
 - launches the management shell
 - does not need to be the same master/primary node other programs use as their master/primary node. It does not tell your program which master node it should use.
 - is the node from which the plugins will be synced
 - does not automatically launch a client on the same node.
 The clients:
 - are the nodes on which commands will be run
 - do not offer a user interface
